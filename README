I tested my solution through the tests written in tests.py which includes sanity tests and performance tests.
I tested common and edge cases in sanity tests and mainly tried to test for performance in the performance tests.
I would like to try out different solutions if I had more time (for example, hashing each rule into a hashset and
checking packets against a hashset which would take more memory (especially when there's a range involved) but would be faster
than simply checking each packet against every individual rule.

My ranking of the teams are:
top choice: platform
second choice: data
third choice: policy
